  - Firstly the answer will always be yes because it always possible to make gcd(B) > 1 when A always have more than 2 numbers.
  - It easy to regconize that if we can make all the number in the array to even the gcd(B) >= 2
  - To minimize the step we define f[i] is the minimal step to make 


Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n) for DP, O(1) for greedy.
